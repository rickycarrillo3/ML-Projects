# Machine Learning Projects
This is a place to gain better understanding of the fundamentals of ML. Its aim is to show the audience that Machine Learning is not something magical but rather a nice combination of various fields of mathematics and the computational power of modern computers. This repo will contain two types of files: demo files, which contain explanations and walk the user through the algorithms and mathematics behind a Machine Learning Algorithm, and project files, which are all code and will often be stored as folders instead.
